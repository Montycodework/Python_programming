# first lets revise For loop

# 1st type
# for item in list_of _item:
  # Do something to each item
  # print(item)

# 2nd Type
# for number in range(a , b):
#   print(number)


#------------------------------------------------

# While Loop
# while something_is_true:
  # do something repeatedly

# Go to reboorg world

# number_of_hurdles = 6
# while number_of_hurdles > 0:
#     jump()
#     number_of_hurdles -= 1
#     print(number_of_hurdles)

# Change the hurdles 2

# def turn_right():
#     turn_left()
#     turn_left()
#     turn_left()
# def jump():
#     move()
#     turn_left()
#     move()
#     turn_right()
#     move()
#     turn_right()
#     move()
#     turn_left()

    
# Hurdle no 1
#def task():
    #jump()
    #jump()
    #jump()
    #jump()
    #jump()
    #jump()

#task()

# Or we can use for loop with jump function

#for step in range(6):
    #jump() 

# Using while loop for doing hurdle no 1

#number_of_hurdles = 6
#while number_of_hurdles > 0:
    #jump()
    #number_of_hurdles -= 1
    #print(number_of_hurdles)
    
# Hurdle no 2 with while loop

#number_of_hurdles = 6
#while number_of_hurdles > 0:
    #if at_goal() == True:
        #done()
    #else:
        #jump()
    #number_of_hurdles -= 1
    #print(number_of_hurdles)
    
# another way
#while at_goal != True:
    #jump()
#while not at_goal():
    #jump()


# Q How we can identify that we need to use for loop or while Loop

# ans  For loop is basically use to iterate(Accessing) every items from any list and do something in range also 
# but while loop is used when u want to just do a task in repetetive manner until some condition
# true or false  no matter what is the item and how many items there..


# INFINITE while loop

# while 5 > 3:
#   print("Hello")

# Go to hurdle 3 in reboorg world  

# Hurdle no 3
# def doge_wall():
#     turn_left()
#     move()
#     turn_right()
#     move()
#     turn_right()
#     move()
#     turn_left()
    
    

# while not at_goal():
#     if wall_in_front():
#         doge_wall()
#     else:
#         move()


# Hurdle 4

# Hurdle no 4


# def jump_wall():
#     turn_left()
#     while wall_on_right():
#         move()
#     turn_right()
#     move()
#     turn_right()
#     while front_is_clear():
#         move()
#     turn_left()
    
# while not at_goal():
#     if wall_in_front():
#         jump_wall()
#     else:
#         move()


# Final project maze

# def turn_right():
#     turn_left()
#     turn_left()
#     turn_left()

# while not at_goal():
#     if right_is_clear():
#         turn_right()
#         move()
#     elif front_is_clear():
#         move()
#     else:
#         turn_left()

# Yha direction ka problem aagya he jo abhi aap solve nhi kar paoge        
# Complete the day 15 come back to this problem and then u r able to solve this kind of problems

# for loop 
# for loops are generally used with the lists
list1 = ["Helli","julia","World"]

for item in list1:
  print(item) # it ll print the all items from the list1. with seperate lines.
  print(item + " item from list1")
print(list1)# here this print function is not in foor loop because the indentation is zero before print function.

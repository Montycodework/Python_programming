# string 
"Hello"
print("Hello"[0]) # This is how you can print the individual letter you want of your string inside print command this
# is called subscripting by using [] brackets.

# Again try with another number inside []
print("Hello"[4])
# you ll got o from "Hello"

print("123"+"345") # The data type in this print command is strings so it mean that you can concatinate the string with
# string

# Integer
123 345
print(123 + 345) # But this time you are using a different data type of integer so you get the different result 

# Float numbers
2.345
24.56
print(2.345 + 24.56) # this time you are using a float values which comes with the decimals inside them and actually
# act as a integer with decimals
